[FireEye, a Top Cybersecurity Firm, Says It Was Hacked by a Nation-State](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/technology/fireeye-hacked-russians.html)

## My Interest

I'll be quite honest, I don't usually keep up with the news--something I've been trying to change!--so the news of this, which definitely seems like something people would have been talking about, totally slipped under my radar. I'd like to say cybersecurity is close enough to software engineering for the purposes of this assignment, but I'll admit I don't know much about cybersecurity, which is a part of why I found this article so interesting. When I typically think of a cyber attack, I usually think of people going after personal information--I never really though of hackers going after the tools security firms use.

## Comment from Lev

The ramifications of this are, indeed, quite concering, though not particularly surprising; given Russian interference in the 2016 United States Presidential Election, it's not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Russian hackers attacking a corporation, even a cyberscurity firm.
